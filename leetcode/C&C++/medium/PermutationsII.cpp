/*
 * Permutations II
 * Given a collection of numbers that might contain duplicates, return all possible unique permutations.
 *
 * For example,
 * [1,1,2] have the following unique permutations:
 * [1,1,2], [1,2,1], and [2,1,1].

// The same code in Permutations.cpp works for this problem too. :)
